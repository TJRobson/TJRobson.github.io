              <ul>
                <li><h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h5></li>
                <li><p>Both are comprised of similar qualities. These being of neutral in mode and reflective in nature. Self-awareness if the action of mindfulness focused back on the self, this is especially true throughout the turmoil. Both take work, and I’m always at work. “My humanity is a constant self-overcoming”.</p></li>
                <li><h5>Try at least one of the self-awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5></li>
                <li><p>I’ve done the Body Scan, I’ll be putting more effort into it from now on. I find I have a looseness within my body afterwards. It’s a good feeling, I also seem less affected my small nuisances.<br>Journaling: I Haven’t tried it yet but, I will. I suspect it’s like talk therapy, psychoanalysis. With the action of expelling the thoughts and putting them outside of the mind, is the catharsis. It transforms the thought into outside the body and in effect gives you the ability to see it with outside perspective.</p></li>
                <li><h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5></li>
                <li><p>I’ve known this for a while. When men, in particular, there is a propensity towards anger. It’s nearly always the result of a loss of some kind, be it, of face or esteem, money or capital, power or control or possibly their stake in a relationship. The self-reflective person would see the loss and acknowledge it. Emotions can be a form of performance,  a performance where the focus is on the excess. It is a self-indulgence in which someone can ramp up the value of their daily life.</p></li>
