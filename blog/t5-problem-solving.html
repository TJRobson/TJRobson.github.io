              <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
              <p class="date">05th August, 2016</p>
              <ul>
                <li><h5>Got blocked on a simple problem.</h5></li>
                <li><p>Yes. All the time haha. Every problem seems like a challenge for the past five weeks</p></li>
                <li><h5>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h5></li>
                <li><p>A small mistake I made recently, was that I had too much space around my blog post titles on my index.html page. I was trying to break down where all the extra space was coming from. So I guess that I was doing a whole lot ‘trying something’, and I got almost nowhere. Then It occurred to me whilst heading to bed that, I may have done something wrong with the HTML. I realised that I had copied and pasted the container element with everything else, so every row had its own container and was taking on those ‘Skeleton’ properties. All I had to do was put all the rows into one container. I realised that a number of problems are going to appear straight forwards once you are aware of the answer.</p></li>
                <li><h5>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h5></li>
                <li><p>Pseudocode - I have found that if a say things out loud, I tend to better comprehend them. But I haven’t really written any yet.</p></li>
                <li><p>Trying something - I’ve started doing this a lot, mostly unsuccessfully but it does help me to see how something might work</p></li>
                <li><p>Rubber ducky method - This is why some people have cats. I’ll have to try find my own thing to talk to.</p></li>
                <li><p>Reading error messages - Not so comfortable with this yet. I can see myself using them more from now on.</p></li>
                <li><p>Googling - This is my go to, it’s mostly good. I still have trouble with forming the question for the desired answer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Asking your peers for help - Need to this more, I have been relying on my sister for help.</p></li>
                <li><p>Asking coaches for help - I’m quite traditional and really like to ask for help in the flesh. I struggle reaching out online.</p></li>
                <li><p>Improving your process with reflection - I do a lot of things on the fly at the moment. So This is good at recognizing areas I can refine, which is all on them.</p></li>
                <li><h5>I’ll attempt to describe what these functions do in my own words:</h5></li>
                <li><p><strong>.map()</strong> takes in an array with transforming expression. Then duplicates a transformed value for all of the original array’s values.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>.filter()</strong> takes in the values of an array along with an boolean expression. It then duplicates those values that meet the expressions conditions or are ‘true’</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>.reduce()</strong> takes in values of an array and accumulates or condenses the value into a single value.</p></li>
