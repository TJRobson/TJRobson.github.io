            <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>It is dividing up the space of a web page up with columns, columns run vertically. Designating a proportion of space to a column within CSS, allows you to use it as a class on HTML tags, which dictates how much screen width the HTML element will fill up. This makes it a lot easier to layout objects and changes how things will be displayed on small screens.</p>     
            <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive web pages?</h3>
            <p>With more and more people using mobile devices to view and interact with websites. Websites that are able to adjust to the device that they are being viewed on, can ensure that users have positive interaction no matter what the device that is being used.</p> 
            <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p>A HTML semantic tag is one that denotes its content, such as img, a, p. Semantic structure takes this further and accepts that websites have shown over time to have universal attributes, such as, header, footer, aside, nav, section, article. This minimises the need to use divs with differing classes.</p>
