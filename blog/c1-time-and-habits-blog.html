            <h3>Time Managment and Creating Habits</h3>
            <p class="date">3rd July, 2016</p></br>
              <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
              <p>I download the Mindfull app onto my phone. Yet to really start to use it, I’ll start today.</p>
              <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
              <p>Pomodoro was interesting, it is sort of like treating all your tasks as if your boiling eggs haha. 
                Meditation: In the past I read about how a buddhist monk who participated in a neurological study could begin to trigger the eureka moment more often and almost by choice. He achieved this through meditation. I believe this has huge implications for any who thinks of them self as being creative.
                In the video “how to create a habit” there is an example about A professional that doesn’t arrive to his office till 3pm. The speaker admired his ability to understand what works for him. I believe to make changes knowing what works for you is very key. 
                The Habits of Successful People: They Start Small, was a good read and mirrors some of my breakthroughs since graduating from art school. One is that big ideas can be fun but being fanciful with ideas/projects is more about ego rather than real interest. It also renders them nearly impossible.</p>
              <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
              <p>I’ll say meditation.
                Starting small.</p>
              <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
              <p>Meditation.
                I’ve always found exercise and eating well key to my productivity.  I really looking forward to the yoga sessions during phase 1.</p>
