              <h4>Time Managment and Creating Habits</h4>

                <ul>   
                  <li><h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>I download the Mindfull app onto my phone. Yet to really start to use it, I’ll start today.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>What did I find interesting?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>Pomodoro was interesting, it is sort of like treating all your tasks as if your boiling eggs haha. Meditation: In the past I read about how a buddhist monk who participated in a neurological study could begin to trigger the eureka moment more often and almost by choice. He achieved this through meditation. I believe this has huge implications for any who thinks of them self as being creative.In the video “how to create a habit” there is an example about A professional that doesn’t arrive to his office till 3pm. The speaker admired his ability to understand what works for him. I believe to make changes knowing what works for you is very key. The Habits of Successful People: They Start Small, was a good read and mirrors some of my breakthroughs since graduating from art school. One is that big ideas can be fun but being fanciful with ideas/projects is more about ego rather than real interest. It also renders them nearly impossible.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>What worked for you?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>I’ll say meditation.Starting small.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>Meditation.I’ve always found exercise and eating well key to my productivity.  I really looking forward to the yoga sessions during phase 1.</p></li>
