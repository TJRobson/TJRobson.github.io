              <h4>Meditation Process</h4>

                <li><h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5></li>
                <li><p>I was conscious of the fact, that at times I was getting way too caught up in small details. A couple small details took up the vast majority of the time spent on the site. Which was a process in itself.  </p></li>
                <li><p>Before watching the second chapter of ‘Search Inside Yourself’, I had developed a positive outlook of meditation, although I had never ventured to try it out for myself.
                I had begun to use the app ‘Headspace’, which has ten ten minute sessions. These sessions for the most part, resemble methods of meditation described by Chade-Meng Tan in chapter two. My experiences thus far, have been that after there is a noticeable sense of calm. I develop perspective on things that would have bothered me before. I have noticed that any activity that takes you away from everyday life, and allows you to passively contemplate, have the same effect. Such as going for a walk, swim or doing yoga. 
                I think going forwards I’ll vary the activity, so that the sensations stay fresh.</p></li>
