              <ul>
                <li><h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS, and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5></li>
                <li><p>An analogy could be that of conversation. In conversation, words are strung together. Words are like containers, they have their own meanings and concepts. This is like HTML, with tags building structure. But words don’t live in isolation, their meanings are not fixed and are added to by outward influences. CSS has influenced the words and sentences of HTML from the outside. When an influence shifts the way a word is understood, this changes the message that is heard. The message heard is the DOM.</p>
                <li><h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5>
                <li><p>All forms of flat media tend to be box-shaped and can be broken down into boxes. Their wholeness is box shaped, examples of this are magazines, newspapers, photos, websites, tv and movies. Today most of these formats are displayed on screens, which in themselves are boxed. Boxifiying design is to take this initial box and dissect it further, forming more boxes. The way these corresponding boxes are arranged can be done to suit people's instinctive viewing tendencies, forming a hierarchy of content.</p>
                <li><h5>What is the box model?</h5>
                <li><p>The box model is a developers tool. The box model is a box that wraps all HTML elements. It is based on the values of content, padding, border and margin. Each  of these has a corresponding area value, combining all these is the entire area of the box. Being able to control the way an element influences space is how the layout is formed.</p>
                <li><p>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.</p></li>
                <li><p>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.</p></li>
                <li><p>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.</p></li>
                <li><p>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.</p></li>
              </ul>   
              <ul>
                <li><h5>My Feature Wish List</h5></li>  
                <li>
                  <h5><a href="http://thisispaper.com/mankichi-shinshi-distant-city/">Thisispaper</a></h5>
                  <p>I like how this blog takes an image from the work being exhibited and displays it as a banner. It also neatly overlays the creator’s name, keywords and the title of the series.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5><a href="http://www.mackconcepttokyo.com/">Mack Concept Tokyo</a></h5>
                  <p>This site has a nice header, nav. It is a single column layout, I think it works better when there’s a lack of content. The overlay over the images is also nice.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5><a href="http://www.wired.com/category/culture/">Wired</a></h5>
                  <p>Wired has the nicest navbar of them all. Very pretty. It also has the more centered layout.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/217/">Screen Filler by Elliot Jay Stocks</a></h5>
                  <p>This one uses no imagery and is a good example what can be done with CSS. I’d like use more layering.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/221/">Mid Century Modern by Andrew Lohman</a></h5>
                  <p>Another example that fully uses space and colour. The page scrolling is nice. Would like to use this for sequential blog posts.</p>
