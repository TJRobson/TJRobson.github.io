            <h3>Cultural Blog - Emotional Intelligence</h3>
            <p class="date">12th July, 2016</p>
            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p>I liked how they brought to focus back on the body, and how the body can sense ahead of the mind when something is amiss. That there is this physical intuition or gut feeling that can be trained, and by recognising these feelings you can discover something earlier.</p>
            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>I have been using the Headspace app for mediation, which does this as part of the course. I’m finding that my mind is quite vacant at the moment, I’m not sure if it's a bad thing haha. This I know with certainty, is that I am terrible at living in the moment and it's something I really need to work on.</p>
