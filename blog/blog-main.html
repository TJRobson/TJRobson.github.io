            <h3>My Reflections</h3>
            <p class="date">2nd July, 2016</p></br>
              <h3>What is your take on the BDC/EDA experience?</h3>
              <p>Haha, It’s unlike anything else I have ever experienced. It would appear that it is designed to totally overhaul ones fixed norms, and to challenge their conceptions of work, life and their overall well being.</p>
              <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
              <p>It’s still too early for me to say. But some of my initial impressions are, that it could be fun whilst being challenging.</p>
              <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
              <p>I think at first I’ll be a little hesitant to fully engage, but in no time I’ll be completely immersed and will do well.</p>
              <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
              <p>I didn’t have many that I could relate it to so, I wasn’t going in with too many expectations. </p>
              <h3>Are you excited to participate in the kind of learning environment? Does it make nervous?</h3>
              <p>Initially I’m very cautious with my decision making. So I feel mostly nervous and unsure as what to expect. I tend to become excited once I start to see things emerge. I became pretty excited whist working on this (my first) website. I worked on it with my sister, which I quite liked doing. Working together made it more rewarding. </p>
              <h3>In regards to the Shereef’s web chat:</h3>
              <p>Overall I really  liked it and found it reassuring. I really liked Shereef’s analogy about how becoming a developer is like walking to another city. And while it would seem like others in the cohort are well ahead of you, in reality it’s only a couple small steps. I found this really reassuring. On the other hand, the response to the question on dropout rates elicited some anxiety. If someone said to me they were given 95% chance of surviving a open heart surgery, I would say that’s excellent and that’s life or death. But hearing that 5% of people are will not complete the program and it gives me the sh**s a little.</p>

            <h3>Time Managment and Creating Habits</h3>
            <p class="date">3rd July, 2016</p></br>
              <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
              <p>I download the Mindfull app onto my phone. Yet to really start to use it, I’ll start today.</p>
              <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
              <p>Pomodoro was interesting, it is sort of like treating all your tasks as if your boiling eggs haha. 
                Meditation: In the past I read about how a buddhist monk who participated in a neurological study could begin to trigger the eureka moment more often and almost by choice. He achieved this through meditation. I believe this has huge implications for any who thinks of them self as being creative.
                In the video “how to create a habit” there is an example about A professional that doesn’t arrive to his office till 3pm. The speaker admired his ability to understand what works for him. I believe to make changes knowing what works for you is very key. 
                The Habits of Successful People: They Start Small, was a good read and mirrors some of my breakthroughs since graduating from art school. One is that big ideas can be fun but being fanciful with ideas/projects is more about ego rather than real interest. It also renders them nearly impossible.</p>
              <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
              <p>I’ll say meditation.
                Starting small.</p>
              <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
              <p>Meditation.
                I’ve always found exercise and eating well key to my productivity.  I really looking forward to the yoga sessions during phase 1.</p>
