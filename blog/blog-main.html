            <h3>My Reflections</h3>
            <p class="date">2nd July, 2016</p></br>
              <h3>What is your take on the BDC/EDA experience?</h3>
              <p>Haha, It’s unlike anything else I have ever experienced. It would appear that it is designed to totally overhaul ones fixed norms, and to challenge their conceptions of work, life and their overall well being.</p>
              <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
              <p>It’s still too early for me to say. But some of my initial impressions are, that it could be fun whilst being challenging.</p>
              <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
              <p>I think at first I’ll be a little hesitant to fully engage, but in no time I’ll be completely immersed and will do well.</p>
              <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
              <p>I didn’t have many that I could relate it to so, I wasn’t going in with too many expectations. </p>
              <h3>Are you excited to participate in the kind of learning environment? Does it make nervous?</h3>
              <p>Initially I’m very cautious with my decision making. So I feel mostly nervous and unsure as what to expect. I tend to become excited once I start to see things emerge. I became pretty excited whist working on this (my first) website. I worked on it with my sister, which I quite liked doing. Working together made it more rewarding. </p>
              <h3>In regards to the Shereef’s web chat:</h3>
              <p>Overall I really  liked it and found it reassuring. I really liked Shereef’s analogy about how becoming a developer is like walking to another city. And while it would seem like others in the cohort are well ahead of you, in reality it’s only a couple small steps. I found this really reassuring. On the other hand, the response to the question on dropout rates elicited some anxiety. If someone said to me they were given 95% chance of surviving a open heart surgery, I would say that’s excellent and that’s life or death. But hearing that 5% of people are will not complete the program and it gives me the sh**s a little.</p>

            <h3>Time Managment and Creating Habits</h3>
            <p class="date">3rd July, 2016</p></br>
              <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
              <p>I download the Mindfull app onto my phone. Yet to really start to use it, I’ll start today.</p>
              <h3>What did I find interesting?</h3>
              <p>Pomodoro was interesting, it is sort of like treating all your tasks as if your boiling eggs haha. 
                Meditation: In the past I read about how a buddhist monk who participated in a neurological study could begin to trigger the eureka moment more often and almost by choice. He achieved this through meditation. I believe this has huge implications for any who thinks of them self as being creative.
                In the video “how to create a habit” there is an example about A professional that doesn’t arrive to his office till 3pm. The speaker admired his ability to understand what works for him. I believe to make changes knowing what works for you is very key. 
                The Habits of Successful People: They Start Small, was a good read and mirrors some of my breakthroughs since graduating from art school. One is that big ideas can be fun but being fanciful with ideas/projects is more about ego rather than real interest. It also renders them nearly impossible.</p>
              <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
              <p>I’ll say meditation.
                Starting small.</p>
              <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
              <p>Meditation.
                I’ve always found exercise and eating well key to my productivity.  I really looking forward to the yoga sessions during phase 1.</p>

            <h3>Technical Blog Part 1 - Udacity Reflection</h3>
            <p class="date">11th July, 2016</p></br>
            <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS, and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
            <p>An analogy could be that of conversation. In conversation, words are strung together. Words are like containers, they have their own meanings and concepts. This is like HTML, with tags building structure. But words don’t live in isolation, their meanings are not fixed and are added to by outward influences. CSS has influenced the words and sentences of HTML from the outside. When an influence shifts the way a word is understood, this changes the message that is heard. The message heard is the DOM.</p>
            <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
            <p>All forms of flat media tend to be box-shaped and can be broken down into boxes. Their wholeness is box shaped, examples of this are magazines, newspapers, photos, websites, tv and movies. Today most of these formats are displayed on screens, which in themselves are boxed. Boxifiying design is to take this initial box and dissect it further, forming more boxes. The way these corresponding boxes are arranged can be done to suit people's instinctive viewing tendencies, forming a hierarchy of content.</p>
            <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
            <p>The box model is a developers tool. The box model is a box that wraps all HTML elements. It is based on the values of content, padding, border and margin. Each  of these has a corresponding area value, combining all these is the entire area of the box. Being able to control the way an element influences space is how the layout is formed.
              <ul>
                <li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.</li>
                <li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.</li>
                <li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.</li>
                <li>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="date">11th July, 2016</p></br>
            <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>It is dividing up the space of a web page up with columns, columns run vertically. Designating a proportion of space to a column within CSS, allows you to use it as a class on HTML tags, which dictates how much screen width the HTML element will fill up. This makes it a lot easier to layout objects and changes how things will be displayed on small screens.</p>     
            <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive web pages?</h3>
            <p>With more and more people using mobile devices to view and interact with websites. Websites that are able to adjust to the device that they are being viewed on, can ensure that users have positive interaction no matter what the device that is being used.</p> 
            <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p>A HTML semantic tag is one that denotes its content, such as img, a, p. Semantic structure takes this further and accepts that websites have shown over time to have universal attributes, such as, header, footer, aside, nav, section, article. This minimises the need to use divs with differing classes.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Blog - Emotional Intelligence</h3>
            <p class="date">12th July, 2016</p></br>
            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p>I liked how they brought to focus back on the body, and how the body can sense ahead of the mind when something is amiss. That there is this physical intuition or gut feeling that can be trained, and by recognising these feelings you can discover something earlier.</p>
            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>I have been using the Headspace app for mediation, which does this as part of the course. I’m finding that my mind is quite vacant at the moment, I’m not sure if it's a bad thing haha. This I know with certainty, is that I am terrible at living in the moment and it's something I really need to work on.</p>
