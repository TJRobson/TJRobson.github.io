              <h4>My Reflections, Week One</h4> 
              <p class="post-date">2nd July, 2016</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li><h5>What is your take on the BDC/EDA experience?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>Haha, It’s unlike anything else I have ever experienced. The program seems that it has been designed to totally overhaul ones fixed norms, and to challenge their conceptions of work, life and overall well being.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>What are your impressions?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>It’s still too early for me to say. But some of my initial impressions are, that it could be fun whilst being challenging.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>I think at first I’ll be a little hesitant to fully engage, but in no time I’ll be completely immersed and will do well.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>I didn’t have many that I could relate it to so, I wasn’t going in with too many expectations. </p></li>
                  <li><h5>Are you excited to participate in the kind of learning environment? Does it make nervous?</h5></li>
                  <li><p>Initially I’m very cautious with my decision making. So I feel mostly nervous and unsure as what to expect. I tend to become excited once I start to see things emerge. I became pretty excited whist working on this (my first) website. I worked on it with my sister, which I quite liked doing. Working together made it more rewarding. </p></li>
                  <li><h5>In regards to the Shereef’s web chat:</h5></li>
                  <li><p>Overall I really  liked it and found it reassuring. I really liked Shereef’s analogy about how becoming a developer is like walking to another city. And while it would seem like others in the cohort are well ahead of you, in reality it’s only a couple small steps. I found this really reassuring. On the other hand, the response to the question on dropout rates elicited some anxiety. If someone said to me they were given 95% chance of surviving a open heart surgery, I would say that’s excellent and that’s life or death. But hearing that 5% of people are will not complete the program and it gives me the sh**s a little.</p></li>
