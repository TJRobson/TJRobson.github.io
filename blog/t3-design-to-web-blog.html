              <ul>
                <li><h5>EDA Week three:</h5></li>
                <li><p>The focus this week was on responsiveness and responsive websites,mobile first design, frameworks and wireframes. Put in a line, it sounds like it was a full week.</p></li>
                <li><p>A responsive site is one that adapts to fit best the device, that it is being accessed on. This is important as, it becomes more common for a mobile to be someone's primary choice. Another influencing trend, is that of people accessing information while on the go, they benefit from lighter sites that prioritise the desired content first.</p></li>
                <li><p>Mobile first design. Start with the mobile site and work up. This design approach forces one to really consider what content is deemed essential. As the viewing portal is much small and use touch interaction, it is important design features accordingly. It makes more sense to scale up or add in additional content, as the visual real estate and computing power increases.</p></li>
                <li><p>Wireframing, as my major while studying for a BFA was photography, and the school having notable design programs. Wireframes remind me of storyboarding, shot planning or any preliminary work by designers. When I undertake these sorts of tasks, I am really rough and tend to do them for myself, and they are of little help to others. The advantage of this process, is that it forces you to think through a visual scenario first. You can develop a greater understanding of the goal(s) before spending any time undertaking the making of. The down side, it can lead to fixed ideas. When flexibility or the need to adlib is required they can cause conflicts. Also I tend to chuck over half of it away any way.</p></li>
